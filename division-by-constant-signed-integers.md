# Division by constant signed integers

The code accompanying this article can be found in a [github repository](https://github.com/rubenvannieuwpoort/division-by-constant-integers).

Division is a relatively slow operation. When the divisor is constant, the division can be optimized significantly. In [division by constant unsigned integers](https://rubenvannieuwpoort.nl/posts/division-by-constant-unsigned-integers) I explored how this can be done for unsigned integers. In this follow-up article, I cover how we can optimize division by constant signed integers. This article essentially provides the same information as [1].

To optimize signed division, we want to round $\frac{n}{d}$ toward zero. This presents some challenges which are different than those for optimizing unsigned division. We are only dealing with numbers with a magnitude of at most $2^{N - 1}$, and we will see that this means we can always use the round-up method. However, the rounding presents a challenge, since we want to round up when the dividend $n$ is negative. Most of the complexity in the implementation comes from correctly handling the rounding.


## Mathematical background

### Preliminaries

I will assume that we are working on an $N$-bit machine which can efficiently compute the full $2N$-bit product of two $N$-bit signed integers. I will use the notation $\mathbb{U}_N$â€‹ for the set of unsigned integers that can be represented with $N$ bits:
$$ \mathbb{U}_N = \{ 0, 1, ..., 2^N - 1 \} $$

Likewise, I will use the notation $\mathbb{S}_N$ for the set of signed integers that can be represented with $N$ bits:
$$ \mathbb{S}_N = \{ -2^{N - 1}, -2^{N - 1} + 1, ..., 2^{N - 1} - 1 \} $$

When $A$ and $B$ are sets, the set $A \setminus B$ denotes the set of elements of $A$ that are not in $B$.

For some real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$, I will denote the absolute value of $x$ by $|x|$. That is:
$$ |x| = \begin{cases} x & \text{when $x \geq 0$} \\ -x & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

I will use the notation $\lfloor x \rfloor$ for the biggest integer smaller than or equal to $x$, and $\lceil x \rceil$ for the smallest integer bigger than or equal to $x$. I will use $[ x ]$ to denote the value of $x$ when rounded toward zero. That is
$$ [x] = \begin{cases} \lceil x \rceil & \text{when $x < 0$} \\ \lfloor x \rfloor & \text{when $x \geq 0$} \end{cases}$$

I will use the notation $\text{sgn}(x)$ for the *sign function*:
$$ \text{sgn}(x) = \begin{cases} -1 & \text{when $x < 0$} \\ 0 & \text{when $x = 0$} \\ 1 & \text{when $x > 0$} \end{cases}$$

Finally, I will use the notation $1_P$ where $P$ is a predicate to denote the *characteristic function*:
$$ 1_P = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{when $P$ is false} \\ 1 & \text{when $P$ is true} \end{cases}$$


### Signed division

The following result will come in handy for negative dividends.

**Lemma**: *Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}, d \in \mathbb{N}_+$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}$. When*
$$ \frac{n - 1}{d} \leq x < \frac{n}{d} $$

*then*
$$ \lfloor x \rfloor = \left \lceil \frac{n}{d} \right \rceil - 1 $$

**Proof**: Set $\frac{n - 1}{d} = a + \frac{b}{d}$ with $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, $b \in \{ 0, 1, ..., d - 1 \}$. Then $\frac{n}{d} = a + \frac{b + 1}{d}$. Now $\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{d} \rfloor = a$ and $\lceil \frac{n}{d} \rceil = a + 1$ so that $\lceil \frac{n}{d} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n - 1}{d} \rfloor + 1$. So $\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{d} \rfloor \leq \lfloor x \rfloor < \lfloor \frac{n - 1}{d} \rfloor + 1$. Since $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is an integer, it follows that $x = \lfloor \frac{n - 1}{d} \rfloor = \lceil \frac{n}{d} \rceil - 1$.
$\square$


**Lemma 1**: *Let $d, m, N \in \mathbb{N}_+$. If*
$$ 2^{N - 1 + \ell} < m \cdot d \leq 2^{N - 1 + \ell} + 2^\ell $$

*then*
$$\left \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} \right \rfloor = \left \lceil \frac{n}{d} \right \rceil - 1 $$

*for all negative $n \in \mathbb{S}_N$.*

**Proof**: Multiply $2^{N - 1 + \ell} < m \cdot d \leq 2^{N - 1 + \ell} + 2^\ell$ by $\frac{n}{d \cdot 2^{N + \ell}}$. Remember that $n$ is negative, so the inequality 'flips' and we get $\frac{n}{d} + \frac{n}{2^{N - 1}} \cdot \frac{1}{d} \leq \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} < \frac{n}{d}$. Now, using that $-2^{N - 1} < n$ we see that $-1 \leq \frac{n}{2^{N - 1}}$, so we have $\frac{n}{d} - \frac{1}{d} \leq \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} < \frac{n}{d}$. The result now follows from lemma 1.
$\square$

**Theorem 2**: *Let $d$ and $N$ be integers with $N > 0$ and define $\ell = \lceil \log_2(|d|) \rceil$ and $m = \lfloor \frac{2^{N - 1 + \ell}}{|d|} \rfloor + 1$. Then $m \in \mathbb{U}_N \setminus \mathbb{U}_{N - 1}$ and*
$$[ \frac{n}{d} ] = \text{sgn}(d) \cdot \left(\left \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} \right \rfloor + 1_{n < 0} \right)$$

*for all $n \in \mathbb{S}_N$.*

**Proof**: When $n \geq 0$ we have $\left \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} \right \rfloor + 1_{n < 0} = \left \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} \right \rfloor$. By replacing $N$ by $N - 1$ in [theorem 3](https://rubenvannieuwpoort.nl/posts/division-by-constant-unsigned-integers) we see that $\left \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} \right \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{|d|} \rfloor = [ \frac{n}{|d|} ]$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_{N - 1}$, so this also holds for all positive $n \in \mathbb{S}_N$. When $n < 0$ we have $1_{n < 0} = 1$. From lemma 2 we see that $\left \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} \right \rfloor = \left \lceil \frac{n}{|d|} \right \rceil - 1$, so that $\left \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} \right \rfloor + 1 = \lceil \frac{n}{|d|} \rceil = [ \frac{n}{|d|} ]$ for all negative $n \in \mathbb{S}_N$. Combining these results we see that $[ \frac{n}{|d|} ] = \left \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N - 1 + \ell}} \right \rfloor + 1_{n < 0}$. Using $[ \frac{n}{d} ] = \text{sgn}(d) \cdot [ \frac{n}{|d|} ]$ the result follows.
$\square$


## Implementation

In this section, I use the `uint` and `sint` datatypes, which are an $N$-bit unsigned integer and an $N$-bit signed integer, respectively. I try to provide a general strategy that should work well on most instruction set architectures. Variations in the implementation might give a more efficient result. In general, you should always benchmark your implementation if performance is critical.

While theorem 2 in the previous section seems to provide a straightforward method to compute the quotient $[ \frac{n}{d} ]$ for any $n, d \in \mathbb{S}_N$, there is one subtlety we glanced over. In theorem 4, we use the $2N$-bit expression $m \cdot n$, where $m \in \mathbb{U}_N$ is an unsigned value and $n \in \mathbb{S}_N$ is a signed value. While most processors have instructions to compute the full $2N$-bit product of two $N$-bit unsigned integers or two $N$-bit signed integers, most processors do not provide an instruction to compute the $2N$-bit product of an $N$-bit unsigned integer and an $N$-bit signed integer.

While it is also possible to compute the product $m \cdot n$ by first extending $m$ and $n$ to $2N$-bit signed values and computing the product of those extended values, this is less efficient.


### Computing the product of an unsigned and a signed value

In this section, consider $m$ and $n$ to be $N$-bit bit strings. So these variables no longer represent a number, but purely a series of bits, which can hold a zero or a one. So we write $m = m_{N - 1} m_{N - 2} ... m_1 m_0$, where $m_{N - 1}, ..., m_0 \in \{ 0, 1 \}$ are the individual bits.

Now, we can provide a string $m$ with a value when we interpret it as either an unsigned value $(m)_\text{u}$, or as a signed value $(m)_\text{s}$. These interpretations are defined as
$$ (m)_\text{u} = \sum_{k = 0}^{N - 1} 2^k m_k $$

and
$$ (m)_\text{s} = -2^{N - 1} m_{N - 1} + \sum_{k = 0}^{N - 2} 2^k m_k $$

We see that $(m)_\text{u} = (m)_\text{s}$ when $m_{N - 1} = 0$ and $(m)_\text{u} = (m)_\text{s} + 2^N$ when $m_{N - 1} = 1$. So when $m_{N - 1} = 0$ we have
$$ (m)_\text{u} \cdot (n)_\text{s} = (m)_\text{s} \cdot (n)_\text{s} $$

So in this case we can just use signed multiplication. When $m_{N - 1} = 1$ we have

$$ (m)_\text{u} \cdot (n)_\text{s} = ((m)_\text{s} + 2^N) \cdot (n)_\text{s} = (m)_\text{s} \cdot (n)_\text{s} + 2^N \cdot (n)_\text{s}$$

So, the upper $N$ bits of the product $(m)_\text{u} \cdot (n)_\text{s}$ equals $\lfloor \frac{(m)_\text{s} \cdot (n)_\text{s}}{2^N} \rfloor + (n)_\text{s}$. This expression can be evaluated by multiplying $m$ and $n$ as if they where signed numbers, taking the upper $N$ bits, and adding $n$ to this.

### Runtime optimization

Consider the following code:
```
sint d = read_divisor();

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	quotient[i] = dividend[i] / d;
}
```

The value of the divisor `d` is not known at compile time, but once it is read at runtime, it does not change. As such, we consider `d` to be a runtime constant, and we can optimize this code in the following way:
```
sint d = read_divisor();
divdata_t divisor_data = precompute(divisor);

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	quotient[i] = fast_divide(dividend[i], divisor_data);
}
```

Now, the `divdata_t` datatype needs to hold $m$, the number of bits to shift, and some field to indicate that we should negate the result $[\frac{n}{|d|}]$ when $d$ is negative:
```
typedef struct {
	uint mul;
	uint shift;
	bool negative;
} divdata_t;
```

Now, we compute $\ell$ such that $m$ always has the most significant bit set. This way we can always compute the upper $N$ bits of the product $m \cdot n$ in `fast_divide` by taking the signed product, taking the upper $N$ bit, and adding $n$ to this.

The precomputation is now a relatively straightforward implementation of theorem 4:
```
sdivdata_t precompute(sint d) {
	sdivdata_t divdata;
	uint d_abs = abs(d);
	
	// Compute ceil(log2(d_abs))
	uint l = floor_log2(d_abs);
	if ((1 << l) < d_abs) l++;

	// Handle case |d| = 1
	if (dabs == 1) l = 1;

	// Compute m = floor(2^(N - 1 + l) / d) + 1
	uint m = (((big_uint)1) << (N - 1 + l)) / d_abs + 1;
	
	divdata.mul = m;
	divdata.negative = d < 0;
	divdata.shift = l - 1;
	return divdata;
}
```

It should be noted that in the `fast_divide` function, the right shift by $N - 1 + \ell$ is implemented by taking the upper $N$ bits of the product $m \cdot n$, and shifting this right by $\ell - 1$ bits. If $\ell = 0$ this is not possible, since in this case we need to shift right by $N - 1$ bits, but taking the $N$ upper bits is already equivalent to a right shift of $N$ bits. We can fix this by simply setting $\ell = 1$ when $|d| = 1$. In this case the expression for $m$ becomes $2^N + 1$, which will overflow to simply $1$. Now, while theorem 4 doesn't hold anymore for $m = 1$, the calculation of the product $m \cdot n$ in `fast_divide` assumes that the most significant bit of $m$ is set, so we will end up with the correct value. In fact, setting $m = 0$ would work as well.

The `fast_divide` function has a lot of steps, but every step should be understandable.

```
sint fast_divide(sint n, sdivdata_t dd) {
	big_sint full_signed_product = ((big_sint)n) * (sint)dd.mul;
	sint high_word_of_signed_product = full_signed_product >> N;
	sint high_word_of_unsigned_product = high_word_of_signed_product + n;
	sint rounded_down_quotient = high_word_of_unsigned_product >> dd.shift;
	sint quotient_rounded_toward_zero = rounded_down_quotient - (n >> (N - 1));
	if (dd.negative) {
		quotient_rounded_toward_zero = -quotient_rounded_toward_zero;
	}
	return quotient_rounded_toward_zero;
}
```


### Compile-time optimization

In this section, I will consider how to generate optimized code for division by compile-time constant signed integers.

Most of the tricks that are applicable to calculate a quotient of unsigned integers efficiently also apply to signed integers, although we might have to do some work to handle negative integers. Of course, a division by one can be ignored and a division by minus one is equivalent to a negation. For some instruction-set architectures, it might be beneficial to implement a special case for big divisors with an absolute value of more than $2^{N - 1}$. In this case, the value of the quotient $[ \frac{n}{d} ]$ is $\text{sgn}(n)$ when $|n| \geq d$ and zero otherwise.

```
expression_t div_by_const_sint(const sint d, expression_t n) {
	if (d == 1) return n;
	if (d == -1) return neg(n);
	uint d_abs = abs(d);
	if (is_power_of_two(d_abs)) return div_by_const_signed_power_of_two(n, d);
	return div_fixpoint(d, n);
}
```

Let us first consider the case where $|d| = 2^\ell$ is a power of two. If we do an arithmetic right shift by $\ell$ bits, the result will be correct when $n$ is positive. However, this will round down the quotient when $n$ is negative. In this case we can add $2^\ell - 1$ to $n$ in order to round up.

So, we would like to have an expression which equals $2^\ell - 1$ when $n$ is negative and $0$ otherwise, so we can simply add this to $n$. The value $2^\ell - 1$ consists of $\ell$ consecutive ones in the binary representation. It can be created by doing an arithmetic right shift by $\ell$ bits on $n$, and shifting the result right by $N - \ell$ bits (with a normal right shift). The first shift produces the $\ell$ ones in the $\ell$ most significant bits when $n$ is negative (these are zero bits otherwise), the second shift puts them in the least significant bit positions.
```
expression_t div_by_const_signed_power_of_two(expression_t n, sint d) {
	uint d_abs = abs(d);
	int l = floor_log2(d_abs);
	
	// addme equals 2^l - 1 when n is negative and 0 otherwise
	// We need to add this to n to round towards zero.
	expression_t addme = shr(sar(n, constant(l - 1)), constant(N - l));
	
	expression_t result = sar(add(n, addme), constant(l));
	if (d < 0) result = neg(result);
	return result;
}
```
