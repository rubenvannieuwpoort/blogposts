# Division by constant unsigned integers

Most modern processors have an integer divide instruction which, for technical reasons, is very slow compared to other integer arithmetic operations. When the divisor is constant, it is possible to transform the division instruction to other instructions which execute faster. Most optimizing compilers perform this optimization, as can be seen on [Matt Godboltâ€™s compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/xrYsbs).

There are some tricks to divide by special divisors: A division by one can be ignored, a division by a power of two can be replaced by a bit shift, and a division by a number that is larger than half of the maximum value of the datatype of the dividend can be replaced by a comparison. By using fixed-point arithmetic, we can speed up division by all constant divisors. However, this is not as simple, and for this reason I will focus only on positive (or 'unsigned') divisors. For a number $n$ and a divisor $d$, I assume that we are interested in the *quotient* $\lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$.

When it is necessary to repeatedly divide floating point numbers by the same constant $c$, it is often preferred to precompute $\frac{1}{c}$ and multiply by this instead. This is usually a lot more efficient. We can do something analogous for integers by using [fixed point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic). The basic idea is to pick a large constant $L$ that is easy to divide by. In decimal you can take some power of ten, in binary you would take a power of two. If we would have $c = \frac{L}{d}$ we would have $\frac{n \cdot c}{L} = \frac{n \cdot \frac{L}{d}}{L} = \frac{n}{d}$. However, $\frac{L}{d}$ is usually not an integer, and we need to round. Still, if $c \approx \frac{L}{d}$ we still expect that $\frac{n \cdot c}{L} \approx \frac{n}{d}$.

In the following section, I'll discuss the mathematical background. In the sections after that, I'll discuss how division by constant unsigned integers can be optimized at compile-time and at runtime.


## Mathematical background

### Preliminaries

I will assume that we are working on an $N$-bit machine which can efficiently compute the full $2N$-bit product of two $N$-bit unsigned integers. I will use the notation $\mathbb{U}_N$ for the set of unsigned integers that can be represented with $N$ bits:
$$ \mathbb{U}_N = \{ 0, 1, ..., 2^N - 1 \} $$

I will use the notation $\text{mod}_d(n)$ to denote the integer in the range $\{ 0, 1, ..., d - 1 \}$ that is equivalent to $n$ modulo $d$. That is, $\text{mod}_d(n)$ is the unique integer such that
$$ 0 \leq \text{mod}_d(n) < d $$

$$ \text{mod}_d(n) = n + m \cdot d $$

for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.

### Unsigned division

In the introduction, we have established that when
$$ m \approx \frac{2^k}{d} $$

then
$$ \frac{n \cdot m}{2^k} $$

For a given divisor $d$, we now want to have an expression that evaluates to $\lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$. We have two demands for this expression:
  1. It should be *correct*, that is, the expression is equal to $\lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$
  2. It should be *efficient to evaluate*. For our purposes, this means that we only want to multiply numbers of at most $N$ bits, so that they fit in a single register on our $N$-bit machine, and that we implement the division by $2^k$ by a bit shift.

Guided by these demands, we can start our analysis. The following lemma will be useful:

**Lemma 1**: *Suppose that $n, d \in \mathbb{N}$ with $d > 0$. If $\frac{n}{d} \leq x < \frac{n + 1}{d}$ then $\lfloor x \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$.*

**Proof**: We have $\frac{n + 1}{d} = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor + \frac{k}{d}$ for some nonnegative integer $k \leq d$. So $\frac{n + 1}{d} = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor + \frac{k}{d} \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor + 1$. It follows that $x \in [ \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor, \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor + 1)$, so that $\lfloor x \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$.
$\square$

At this point, we have only decided that we want an expression that evaluates to $\lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$. We take $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^k} \rfloor$ with $m \approx \frac{2^k}{d}$ as our starting point, since we know that $\frac{m \cdot n}{2^k} \approx \frac{n}{d}$. We now need to answer the following questions:
  1. How do we pick $m$?
  2. How do we pick $k$?

The obvious choice for $m$ are the integers that minimize the error to $\frac{2^k}{d}$, which are $m_\text{down} = \lfloor \frac{2^k}{d} \rfloor$ and $m_\text{up} = \lceil \frac{2^k}{d} \rceil$. Note that when $d$ is not a power of two, we have $\lfloor \frac{d \cdot m_\text{down}}{2^k} \rfloor = 0$. To overcome this, we can simply increase $n$. Based on this, we can come up with the following methods:
  - The **round-up method**, which approximates $\lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ by $\lfloor \frac{m_\text{up} \cdot n}{2^k} \rfloor$ with $m_\text{up} = \lceil \frac{2^k}{d} \rceil$.
  - The **round-down method**, which approximates $\lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ by $\lfloor \frac{m_\text{down} \cdot (n + 1)}{2^k} \rfloor$ with $m_\text{down} = \lfloor \frac{2^k}{d} \rfloor$.

The following theorem gives us a condition under which the round-up method is correct, that is, $\lfloor \frac{m_\text{up} \cdot n}{2^k} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.

**Theorem (Round-up method)**: *Let $d, m, N, l \in \mathbb{N}$ be nonnegative integers with $d > 0$. If*
$$ 2^{N + l} \leq m \cdot d \leq 2^{N + l} + 2^l $$

*then*
$$ \forall n \in \mathbb{U}_N : \lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor $$

**Proof**: Multiplying the inequality by $\frac{n}{d \cdot 2^{N + l}}$ we get
$$ \frac{n}{d} \leq \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N + l}} \leq \frac{n}{d} + \frac{1}{d} \cdot \frac{n}{2^N} $$

For all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$ we have $n < 2^N$, so that $\frac{n}{2^N} < 1$. It follows that
$$ \forall n \in \mathbb{U}_N : \frac{n}{d} \leq \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N + l}} \leq \frac{n}{d} + \frac{1}{d} $$

By lemma 1, it follows that $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.
$\square$

**Corollary 3**: *If $\text{mod}_d(-2^{N + l}) \leq 2^l$ and $m = \lceil \frac{2^{N + l}}{d} \rceil$, then $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.*

**Proof**: Suppose we have $\text{mod}_d(-2^{N + l}) < 2^l$. Then there exists an integer $m$ such that $0 \leq m \cdot d - 2^{N + l} \leq 2^l$ Adding $2^{N + l}$, we see that $2^{N + l} \leq m \cdot d \leq 2^{N + l} + 2^l$. In particular, the lowest $m$ that satisfies this equation is $m = \lceil \frac{2^{N + l}}{d} \rceil$, since $d \cdot \lceil \frac{2^{N + l}}{d} \rceil$ is the first multiple of $d$ that is greater than or equal to $2^{N + l}$. By theorem 2, it follows that $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.
$\square$

The following theorem gives us a condition under which the round-down method is correct, that is, $\lfloor \frac{m_\text{up} \cdot n}{2^k} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.

**Theorem 4**: *Let $d, m, N, l \in \mathbb{N}$ be nonnegative integers with $d > 0$. If*
$$ 2^{N + l} - 2^l \leq m \cdot d < 2^{N + l}$$

*then*
$$ \forall n \in \mathbb{U}_N : \lfloor \frac{m \cdot (n + 1)}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor $$

**Proof**: Multiply the inequality by $\frac{n + 1}{d \cdot 2^{N + l}}$ to get
$$ \frac{n}{d} + \frac{1}{d} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{n + 1}{2^N} \right) \leq \frac{m \cdot (n + 1)}{2^{N + l}} < \frac{n + 1}{d} $$

Looking at the expression on the left side, we have $1 \leq n + 1 \leq 2^N$, so that $0 \leq 1 - \frac{n + 1}{2^N} < 1$. It follows that $\frac{n}{d} \leq \frac{n}{d} + \frac{1}{d} \cdot (1 - \frac{n + 1}{2^N})$, so
$$ \frac{n}{d} \leq \frac{m \cdot (n + 1)}{2^{N + l}} < \frac{n + 1}{d} $$

for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$. So the lemma applies and we have $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot (n + 1)}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.
$\square$

TODO: write something here

**Corollary 5**: If $0 < \text{mod}_d(2^{N + l}) < 2^l$ and $m = \lfloor \frac{2^{N + l}}{d} \rfloor$, then $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot (n + 1)}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.

**Proof**: If $0 < \text{mod}_d(2^{N + l}) \leq 2^l$ and $m - \lfloor \frac{2^{N + l}}{d} \rfloor$, then $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot (n + 1)}{2^{N + l}} = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$. Subtracting $2^{N + l}$, we see that $-2^{N + l} < -m \cdot d \leq -2^{N + l} + 2^l$. Multiplying by $-1$, we get $2^{N + l} - 2^l \leq m \cdot d < 2^{N + l}$. In particular, this condition must hold for $m = \lfloor \frac{2^{N + l}}{d}$, since $d \cdot \lfloor \frac{2^{N + l}}{d} \rfloor$ is the biggest multiple of $d$ that is less than $2^{N + l}$. By theorem 4, it follows that $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot (n + 1)}{2^{N + l}} = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.
$\square$

These two theorems give us a way to know when the methods produce the correct result. Now, the methods are only efficient when the magic number $m$ fits in $N$ bits. Let's define this more rigorously:

**Definition:** *We call a positive divisor $d \in \mathbb{U}_d$ efficient for the $N$-bit round-up method (or round down method) if there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\lfloor \frac{m_\text{up} \cdot n}{2^k} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$. Likewise, we call a positive divisor $d \in \mathbb{U}_d$ efficient for the $N$-bit round-down method (or round down method) if there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\lfloor \frac{m_\text{down} \cdot (n + 1)}{2^k} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.*

The following result tells us the maximum $k$ that we can pick so that $m_\text{up}$ and $m_\text{down}$ still fit in $N$ bits.

**Lemma:** *Let $d \in \mathbb{U}_N$ and define $x = \frac{2^{N + \lceil \log_2(d) \rceil - 1}}{d}$. Now*
$$2^{N - 1} \leq \lfloor x \rfloor \leq \lceil x \rceil \leq 2^N - 1$$

That is, the binary representations of $\lfloor x \rfloor$ and $\lceil x \rceil$ have exactly $N$ bits.

**Proof:** asdf

When $N = 1$, it follows that $d = 1$ and the theorem holds. When $N > 1$, the ratio $\frac{2^{\lceil \log_2(d) \rceil}}{d}$ is maximized over $d \in \mathbb{U}_N$ by $d = 2^{N - 1} + 1$, so $\frac{2^{\lceil \log_2(d) \rceil}}{d} \leq \frac{2^N}{2^{N - 1} + 1} < \frac{2^N - 1}{2^{N - 1}}$ (this last inequality can be seen by multiplying both sides by $2^{N - 1} \cdot (2^{N - 1} + 1)$). So we have $\frac{2^{\lceil \log_2(d) \rceil}}{d} < \frac{2^N - 1}{2^{N - 1}}$; multiplying both sides by $2^{N - 1}$ gives $\frac{2^{N + \lceil \log_2(d) \rceil - 1}}{d} < 2^N - 1$. It follows that $\lceil x \rceil \leq 2^N - 1$.
$\square$

The following theorem tells us that the round-down method is *almost* efficient; for any divisor $d$ we can store $m_\text{up}$ in at most $N + 1$ bits.

**Theorem:** *For any positive divisor $d \in \mathbb{U}_N$, there exist $l \in \mathbb{N_+}$, $m \in \mathbb{U}_{N + 1}$ such that $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$.*

**Proof**: Set $l = \lceil \log_2(d) \rceil$. The range $\{ 2^N, 2^N + 1, ..., 2^N + 2^l \}$ consists of $2^l + 1$ consecutive numbers. We have $2^l + 1 = 2^{} + 1 > d$, so there must be a multiple of $d$ in this range. Using theorem 2, we see that there exists an $m$ such that $\lfloor \frac{m \cdot n}{2^{N + l}} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{d} \rfloor$ for all $n \in \mathbb{U}_N$. It remains to show that $m \in \mathbb{U}_{N + 1}$. TODO
$\square$

The following result finally concludes our quest for an efficient method.

**Theorem:** Any positive divisor $d \in \mathbb{U}_N$ is either efficient for the round-up method, or efficient for the round-down method.

**Proof**: TODO
$\square$

The following condition can be used to implement a more efficient test.

**Lemma 7**: *Let $d$ be a cooperative divisor and let $l = \lceil \log_2(d) \rceil - 1$. If $\text{mod}_{2^N}(\lceil \frac{2^{N + l}}{d} \rceil \cdot d) \leq 2^l$ then $d$ is efficient for the round-up method.*

**Proof**: The product $m \cdot d = \lceil \frac{2^{N + l}}{d} \rceil \cdot d$ is the first multiple of $d$ that is equal to or larger than $2^{N + l}$. So this product will be of the form $2^{N + l} + q$ for some $q < d < 2^N$. We have $\text{mod}_{2^N}(m \cdot d) = q$. It follows that $2^{N + l} \leq m \cdot d \leq 2^{N + l} + 2^l$ if and only if $\text{mod}_{2^N}(m \cdot d) \leq 2^l$.
$\square$

Finally, the following theorem will be useful for the implementation.

**Theorem 8**: *If $d$ is a divisor of $2^N - 1$, then $d$ is a cooperative divisor.*

**Proof**: TODO
$\square$
